Overview
========

radmap is a simple mapping application using libchamplain. The main point of
this application is to allow you to draw one or more circles of specifed
radiuses around specified locations with a label.

To do this, create a markers file with one or more entries with the following
format

    label|latitude|longitude|radius|red|green|blue|alpha

label is what will be shown on the map.
latitude and longitude are the co-ordinates for the centre of the circle.
radius is the radius of the circle. You can specify this in kilometres (km),
miles (mi) or metres. e.g 40km or 25.3mi or 3500
red, green & blue are the colour values to use, each takes a value between
0..255
alpha is the amount of opacity to apply, it takes a value between 0..255
0 is fully transparant and 255 is fully opaque.

You can click a label to have the map zoom in and centre on it.
